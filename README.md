Linear regression - Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable. For example, a modeler might want to relate the weights of individuals to their heights using a linear regression model.  Voting - You can train your model using diverse algorithms and then ensemble them to predict the final output. Say, you use a Random Forest Classifier, SVM Classifier, Linear Regression etc.; models are pitted against each other and selected upon best performance by voting using the VotingClassifier Class from sklearn.ensemble. Hard voting is where a model is selected from an ensemble to make the final prediction by a simple majority vote for accuracy.
